 *
 * This routine reads the data to be transferred over the connection
 * from a file specified and invokes the STCP send functionality to
 * deliver the packets as an ordered sequence of datagrams.

 * Send STCP. This routine is to send all the data (len bytes).  If more
 * than MSS bytes are to be sent, the routine breaks the data into multiple
 * packets. It will keep sending data until the send window is full or all
 * the data has been sent. At which point it reads data from the network to,
 * hopefully, get the ACKs that open the window. You will need to be careful
 * about timing your packets and dealing with the last piece of data.
 *
 * Your sender program will spend almost all of its time in either this
 * function or in tcp_close().  All input processing (you can use the
 * function readWithTimeout() defined in stcp.c to receive segments) is done
 * as a side effect of the work of this function (and stcp_close()).
 *
 * The function returns STCP_SUCCESS on success, or STCP_ERROR on error.

 * Open the sender side of the STCP connection. Returns the pointer to

 *
 * If you use udp_open() it will use connect() on the UDP socket
 * then all packets then sent and received on the given file
 * descriptor go to and are received from the specified host. Reads
 * and writes are still completed in a datagram unit size, but the
 * application does not have to do the multiplexing and
 * demultiplexing. This greatly simplifies things but restricts the
 * number of "connections" to the number of file descriptors and isn't
 * very good for a pure request response protocol like DNS where there
 * is no long term relationship between the client and server.
